<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Software Development Engineer with a passion for backend development.
  My journey in software development began as a Backend Developer Trainee at FunctionUp. During my time there, 
  I honed my skills in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I actively participated in coding competitions organized by
  FunctionUp on platforms like HackerRank and CodeWars, further enhancing my problem-solving abilities and deepening my 
  understanding of backend development best practices. Additionally, I became proficient in using Git for version
  control, facilitating smooth collaboration with other team members. Following my traineeship, I joined Winuall 
  as a Software Development Engineer 1 - Backend, where I assumed a range of responsibilities. My primary focus was
  on developing and maintaining the backend for the Winuall Coaching management web/app, which serves over 5000 
  tutors. I contributed to various modules, including quizzes, attendance tracking, homework management, doubts 
  resolution, content delivery, revenue dashboard, and online store functionality for selling courses, books, 
  and more.

<p> One of my notable achievements at Winuall was the creation of a Slack Bot. This bot generated random 
  passwords for users through a slash command and integrated storage plan notifications on Slack, enhancing user 
  experience and security. I also developed a Python-based microservice using the Pillow library, allowing users 
  to generate marketing posters effortlessly. To ensure seamless integration with the existing infrastructure, 
  I leveraged AWS Lambda and SQS for calling the API of the microservice. During my tenure at Winuall, 
  I also contributed to the development of three microservices for the Edify app. These microservices catered 
  to the needs of over 1000 resellers who were selling electronics, mobiles, and online courses. Leveraging 
  technologies such as Node.js, Golang, TypeScript, MongoDB, Express.js, and Redis.Throughout my career, I have placed great importance on collaboration and alignment with the product team. 
  By closely working with cross-functional teams, I ensure that the projects and innovations I undertake align 
  with business goals and address user needs effectively. This collaborative approach has consistently driven 
  innovation and resulted in successful project deliveries.</p>
  
<p> In summary, I am a dedicated and versatile Software Development Engineer experienced in backend development. 
  My expertise lies in technologies such as Node.js, Express, JavaScript, TypeScript, and MongoDB.</p>
